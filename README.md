# SolidJS Tailwind Tauri

This template should help get you started developing with Tauri + Solid + Typescript + TailwindCSS.

## Cloning it 🐑

You can use the Template button on the GitHub UI and shallow clone this repository. Or, do it with degit:

```sh
npx degit atilafassina/create-solidjs-tailwind-tauri
```

Alternatively, good old `git clone` can also work. It's recommended to make a shallow clone so it doesn't bring entire repository history:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/atilafassina/create-solidjs-tailwind-tauri
```

## Running Dev 🚀

Once the template is properly cloned, install Node.js dependencies and you can run the Tauri app.

```sh
pnpm tauri dev
```

The above example uses [PNPM](https://pnpm.io) as the package manager and task runner, but Yarn, NPM, or Bun should also work.

> 🛟 Check the [Tauri Docs](https://tauri.app) for more guidance on building your app.
